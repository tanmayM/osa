 ---- GOALS OF THIS LIBRARY ----

OSA : Operating System Abstraction

This library is intented to be a wrapper over basic APIs provided by OS, core libraries (e.g. c library) and
provide some other critical application agnostic utilities. This would aid the programmer to write OS independent
code easily and automate/abstract solutions to error prone, repetitive tasks in programming.


ToC
1. Data Types
2. Strings
3. Memory (copy, move etc)
3. Sockets
4. Events
5. Synchronization :: Threads, Semaphores, Mutexes, conditional variables
6. Time utilities
7. Signals
10. Threadpool
11. Logging

It is a C++ library. Wrapper functions could be provided later for using it in C.




Points to remember
-------------------

1. Always compile with 'Treat warning as errors' flag. Mismatch in number of arguments to printf is a nasty error)
	- For gcc give '-Werror' on command line.
